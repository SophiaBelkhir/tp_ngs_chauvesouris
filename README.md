# Practicals NGS Bats 
## Objectives - Characterization of the IFN response in bats
The objective is to investigate the specificities of the bats immune system, in order to understand how bat's immunity has adapted to long-term association with viruses, and why bats harbor a high number of viruses but appear mostly asymptomatic. 
To do so, we want to characterize the interferon (IFN) response in bats. We thus aim at studying the transcriptomic changes in response to IFN stimulation in bat cells, and in particular, we want to identify interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are differentially expressed after IFN stimulation.

We focus on *Myotis velifer*, a bat species for which no transcriptomic data was available yet. We will thus need to assemble the transcriptome of *Myotis velifer*, and because no reference transcriptome is available for this species, perform a *de novo* transcriptome assembly. Then we will have to annotate this transcriptome. Finally, we will quantify the expression of the transcripts, and perform a differential expression analysis.
Here is an overview of the workflow:

### Step 0: Data obtention
RNA was extracted from bat cells exposed or not to IFN during 6 hours. 
Libraries were prepared and paired-end RNA-seq was performed using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. For each condition, 3 samples were sequenced, so we have a total of 6 files containing reads. The sequences are under fastq format. 

To download the raw RNA-seq data from the IGFL sequencing platform, we use the command line in the script **importdataset.sh**.

### Step 1: Quality control
The first step is to verify the quality of the reads.

**1) Quality control with fastqc:** 

We first control the quality of the reads. We run fastqc on each of the obtained sequences, using the script **qualitycontrol_fastqc.sh**. Fastqc uses several statistics to analyze the quality of sequences, and provides html files with a summary. Here is an overview of the fastqc report obtained for a representative sample.
![fastqc report](/imagesreadme/report_fastqc.png)

The quality of the first and last bases of the sequences is not satisfying. This is due to the artefacts of sequencing, for which the first bases are not accurate, and to the presence of adapters at the end of sequences. We need to trim the sequences before starting the assembly.

**2) Sequences trimming with trimmomatic:** 

Trimmomatic is a tool to perform quality trimming, adapter clipping, and eliminate reads that are too short. We use the script **trimmomatic.sh** to run Trimmomatic for each pair of sequences, with the following parameters: ILUMINACLIP:2:30:10 (to use in combination with the file adapt.fasta which contains the sequences of the Illumina adapters), HEADCROP: 9 (to crop the first 9 bases of each read), MINLEN: 100 (to only keep the reads with a minimum length of 100 nucleotides).  
Then we verify the quality of the trimmed sequenced using fastqc on the outputs from Trimmomatic:  **control_fastqc_after_trimm.sh**.
![fastqc after trimming report](/imagesreadme/report_fastqc_aftertrimm.png)

Overall, the quality is now satisfying, and we can proceed to the assembly, using the fastq sequences stored in the outputs_trimmomatic directory.

### Step 2: **De novo** assembly 
Once the sequences have been trimmed and are of a good quality, we use Trinity to assemble the transcriptome. We do not separate the samples by condition for the assembly, and use the paired-end sequences of the 6 samples altogether. We only separate the left and right reads of the samples, because Trinity processes all the right reads together (stored in the variable FASTQ1), and all the left reads together (stored in the variable FASTQ2). We specify the strand-specific RNA-seq read orientation (--SS_lib_type): in our case, the type of sequencing was 'fr-firststrand', which for Trinity corresponds to "RF".
For the script, see **assembly_trinity.sh**. 

We now have an assembled transcriptome (Trinity_RF.fasta), and a table making the correspondence between the gene identifier and the transcript isoforms (Trinity_RF.fasta.gene_trans_map). The assembly is imperfect, and Trinity identifies an abnormally high number of transcripts (around 400,000 transcripts, and around 311,000 genes). This reinforces the need to quantify the expression of the transcripts, in order to only focus on the transcripts that really correspond to genes and that are actually expressed, and get rid of the background noise. 

The next step is thus to annotate the transcriptome. 

### Step 3: Data annotation
In order to annotate the transcriptome, we need: 1) to identify the ORFs from the assembled transcriptome 2) to predict the likely coding regions 3)  to select and create the database of known coding sequences (CDS) against which we will use BLAST to find homologies 4) to perform a local alignment with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to identify genes.

**1) Identifying the ORFs with TransDecoder.Longorfs:**

![Transdecoder principle an doutput](/imagesreadme/transdecoder_ex.png)

We run TransDecoder in two steps, first TransDecoder.Longorfs identifies ORFs within transcript sequences, using the command line in the script **transdec.sh**. The input file is the assembled transcriptome obtained with Trinity, and we use the fasta.gene_trans_map for gene transmap. We specify -s to indicate the strand specificity, and keep the default value of -m (100) to only consider the sequences that would code for proteins of at least 100 amino acids.

**2) Identifying the CDS with TransDecoder.Predict:**

We then use TransDecoder.Predict to identify candidate coding regions within transcript sequences, with the corresponding command line in the script **transdec.sh**. We specify â€“single best only to only keep the best candidate for each transcript. 

We obtain trinity.fasta.transdecoder.cds, a file with all the CDS predicted from the assembled transcriptome. In order to infer to what known coding sequences these correspond, we look for homologies with BLAST. 

**3) Construct a reference database for blast with makeblastdb:**

To annotate the CDS from *Myotis velifer* transcriptome, we compare them to human CDS. We thus need to build a blast database containing human CDS.
We download the known human cds using the wget command from the script **get_human_cds.sh**.

Then we use makeblastdb, using the file with human CDS as input file, and specifying -dbtype 'nucl' -parse_seqids, because we deal with nucleotide sequences, under a fasta format (for command line, see the first part of the **blast.sh** script).

**4) Perform alignment with blastn:**

We then perform the alignment using blastn (because both our query and our database are nucleotides), see the scrip **blast.sh**. 
We use the output from TransDecoder as the query, and the output from makeblastdb as the database for reference. We define the minimal e-value as 1e-4, and max_target_seqs as 1 to only keep one hit by contig. We choose -outfmt 6 to visualize the output as a table summarizing the main features of each hit.

Here is an overview of the output from blast:

### Step 4: Transcript expression quantification
We now wish to quantify the expression for each sample. We use salmon to align the reads on the transcript and quantify how many reads align on the transcript. Salmon comprises several tools to perform transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads using selective alignment, and we use salmon index and salmon quant.

**1) Creating an index with salmon index:**

To perform quantification, salmon first requires the creation of a specific index for the assembled transcriptome (Trinity_RF.fasta). This is the first part of the **salmon_quantif.sh**.

**2) Quantification with salmon quant:**

Then, we proceed to actual quantification with salmon quant. We run salmon quant on each pair of sequences (second part of the **salmon_quantif.sh** script). We use --validateMappings and --gcBias options. 

Of note, only 40% of the reads aligned to the transcriptome, when we expected more around 90%. This is probably because the left and right reads sometimes overlapped, so salmon running in "paired-end" mode does not handle it well. We could try running it as "single-end".

We obtained the count tables quant.sf for each sample. We have counts for each isoform, but now want the counts at the level of the gene, to be able to do differential expression analysis. 

**3) Building a count table per gene:**

Based on the quantifications obtained with salmon, we now want to obtain the expression level for each gene (and not just each transcript or isoform), we build a count table in the first few chunks of the r markdown **Bats_count_tableDEseq.rmd**.

### Step 5: Differential expression analyses
Since our biological question is to know which genes are differentially expressed in interferon stimulated bat cells compared to control ones, we need to do a differential expression analysis. The code is in **Bats_count_tableDEseq.rmd**. 

**1) DESeq2 analysis:**

DEseq2 is used to do statistical tests to define whether a gene is significantly up or down regulated in the treated condition (+IFN) than in the control. DEseq2 uses a corrected variance (for each gene), and runs a generalized linear model to assess if there is a significant difference of expression between the 2 conditions for each gene. It also calculates a p-value adjusted for multiple tests, using the FDR (False Discover Rate) method. 
We obtain a table containing different metrics for each gene, including their normalized expression level (BaseMean), the log fold change when comparing IFN/control (log2FoldChange), the p-value and adjusted p-values (padj) indicating the confidence for rejecting the hypothesis that the gene in question is not differentially expressed in the two conditions. We observe that 1457 genes are differentially expressed in IFN+ conditions compared to control.    

**2) Verifications:**

To visualize and verify the results, we plot a MA-plot and a PCA.
The MA-plot shows the log2 fold changes attributable to a given variable over the mean of normalized counts for all the samples in the DESeq dataset. 
The PCA allows us to verify the clustering of the samples per condition. One of the control samples (Lib3) does not group with the 2 others as expected, we also redid the analysis without this sample, in order to see if it caused an important difference in the results. The DESEq analysis rerun on all samples excluding Lib3 is presented in **Bats_DEseq_without3.rmd** (see the last chunk of this .rmd for a comparison betwwen the number of differentially expressed genes when taking Lib3 into account or not)

**3) Identification of the genes:**

We cross the results of Blast with the outputs from DEseq, in order to identify the names of all the genes identified. To do so, we make the correspondence between ENSEMBL identifiers and external human gene names, using biomaRt. 

**4) Analysis and presentation of the data:**

Finally, to visualize the results, we produced heatmaps, did a Gene Ontology analysis with GOrilla, and compared our results to these of another publication. We did this using the DESeq output obtained when considering all the samples (even Lib3), because there is not a huge difference in the number of genes regulated when considering Lib3 or not, and because we did not want to eliminate one sample out of three and loose statistical power. 

Here is an extract of the Gene Ontology results for upregulated genes:
